Two sets of examples for UDP client and server programs in Java.

**1. Starting a server program:**

Using the console/cmd, compile and run one of the server programs.

**2. Starting a client program:**

Using the console, compile and run one of the client programs by following the structure: java <name of the program file> <IP address> <port number>.

*Note 1:* If there are no input arguments, the default IP address is 'localhost' and the default port number is 9876, which is the port used by the server programs.

*Note 2:* It is assumed that port 9876 is not busy at the time of testing.
